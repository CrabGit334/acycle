```diff
+ With redesigned Acycle GUI, NO coding experience is required.
```
Acycle is a comprehensive, but simple-to-use software package for analysis of time-series designed for paleoclimate research and education. Acycle runs either in the MATLAB environment or as a stand-alone application on Windows and Macintosh OS X <i>(coming)</i>, and is available free of charge.

<i>Acycle provides prewhitening procedures with multiple options available to track or remove secular trends, and integrates various power spectral analysis approaches for detection and tracking of periodic signals. 
Acycle also provides a toolbox that evaluates astronomical signals in paleoclimate series, and estimates the most likely sedimentation rate by maximizing the correlation coefficient between power spectra of an astronomical solution and a paleoclimate series. Sedimentary noise models for sea-level variations are also included. 
Many of the functions are specific to cyclostratigraphy and astrochronology, and are not found in standard, statistical packages. </i>

<b>Installation</b>

[1. MatLab version]: 

Download and unzip the Acyclev0.2.1 software to your root directory.

<br />
<br />
<b>Startup</b>

[1. MatLab version]:

<b>Data requirement</b>

See example data at https://github.com/mingsongli/acycle/tree/master/data/Zhangetal2015PPP

The input file of data series can be in a variety of formats, including table- or space-delimited text (.txt), and comma-separated values files (.csv) from an Excel-type spreadsheet. The data file must contain two columns of series. The first column must be in depth or time, and the second column should be value in the corresponding depth or time. Unit of the series in depth domain should be in meters. The data can be saved in any directory and is recommended to save in Acycle “data” folder. All data files, plots, and folders are displayed in the GUI list box.
